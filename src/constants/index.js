export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about building dynamic, user-friendly web applications. My tech journey started with a curiosity for problem-solving, leading me to master the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) through Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course and Python with MySQL at Besant Technologies, Tambaram. With 3 years as an MIS Executive at Dvara E-Dairy, I developed expertise in data analysis, Excel automation, and reporting, which enhances my ability to create robust solutions.

I thrive on turning ideas into reality, crafting seamless frontends with React and scalable backends with Node.js and databases. Driven by a love for learning and tackling challenges, I'm excited to collaborate on innovative projects. Outside coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies and staying active through outdoor adventures. Let's create something amazing together!`;
